# ng-texthighlighter
This is just a small proof of concept for me to try out Coffeescript with AngularJS. Nothing fancy really - by using the `highlighter` directive you will be able to highlight your text by selecting it. Feel free to extend and contribute :-)

## Demo
It's as simple as cloning the repository and running the included demo. No need to compile or anything, I've already included the compiled JS scripts for you.
